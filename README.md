##NSLayoutConstraint Extensions 

A **useful** category on `NSLayoutConstraint` containing a set of helper methods for creating most commonly used constraints. The category also includes a debugging extension that makes troubleshooting invalid constraints much easier and faster.

It is designed to be **as easy to use as possible to integrate and use** to speed up everyday development tasks. All the methods are well documented and described using doxygen style. 

Furthermore, the category comes along with **a small demo project** where you can see how to use helper methods for creating and debugging constraints.
